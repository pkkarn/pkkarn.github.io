Theming: Robust support for both dark and light modes via CSS variables.
🛠️ Technology Stack
Frontend Framework: React with Vite (lightning-fast development).
Language: TypeScript for type-safe code.
Styling: Tailwind CSS for layout and custom animations.
UI Components: Built on top of Radix UI and shadcn/ui, ensuring accessibility and high quality.
Icons: Lucide React.
Routing: react-router-dom for seamless navigation.
